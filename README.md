probit
======

probit, by Ben Boys (2021), is a lightweight, open-source and high-performance python package for solving ordinal regression problems with Gaussian Processes. It is implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the performance critical parts will be implemented in [Cython](https://cython.org/).

probit allows users to write their code in pure Python. Simulations are then executed seamlessly using high performance and numerically stable code.

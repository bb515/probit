Please do not distribute this private repository.

probit, by Ben Boys (2021), is a lightweight, open-source and high-performance python package for solving ordinal regression problems with Gaussian Processes. It is implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

probit allows users to write their code in pure Python. Simulations are then executed seamlessly using high performance and numerically stable code.

Features
--------
- Exact inference with MCMC (Gibbs sampler or Elliptical slice sampler)
- Approximate inference with mean field Variational Bayes, Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation or Power Expectation Propagation
- Sparse approximate inference applied to Power Expectation Propagation and mean field Variational Bayes
- Gaussian, ARD, linear and polynomial kernel functions
- Fully Bayesian inference with pseudo-marginal approach, auxiliary augmentation or sufficient augmentation.

Planned Features
--------
- numpy linear alegbra operations will be converted to TensorFlow code
